# Sales Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales performance using SQL and Power BI to understand the drivers behind a year-over-year sales decline.

## Business Question
Total sales declined by **4.91%** when comparing 2010 to 2011.  
The goal of this analysis is to identify the main factors behind this change.

## Tools Used
- MySQL
- Power BI

## Analysis Workflow
The analysis was conducted in several stages:

1. Database creation
2. Data modeling (Fact & Dimension tables)
3. Sales-Performance-Analysis
4. Customer-Segmentation-RFM
5. Customer-Lifetime-Value
6. Product performance analysis
7. Returns analysis
8. Time series analysis
9. Business insights

## Key Findings
- Orders decreased by **9%**
- Returns dropped by **49.5%**
- Net revenue increased by **7.9%**

The analysis revealed that sales in 2010 were inflated by extremely high return rates caused by a small group of products.
